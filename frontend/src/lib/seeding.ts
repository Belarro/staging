/**
 * Seeding-date math shared by /api/orders and /api/production.
 *
 * Farm rules (Ron, July 7 2026):
 * - Delivery is always Tuesday.
 * - Seed days: Tuesday for crops that grow >10 days, Friday for crops ≤10 days.
 * - A new order's FIRST delivery is set by its longest crop: seed it at its next
 *   possible slot, deliver on the Tuesday it's ready. Shorter crops in the same
 *   order seed LATER (first delivery − their grow days, snapped back to their
 *   seed day) so everything is ready together.
 * - After the first seed date every crop repeats weekly (biweekly = every 2nd week,
 *   anchored to its first delivery).
 * - On a crop swap, the old crop's pipeline keeps delivering; the new crop's first
 *   delivery is the Tuesday AFTER the old crop's last batch delivers.
